# NLP_Research
Beginning the winter of 2021, I have beening do some simple NLP research with the help of a teacher from Nanjing University, who I really thank for. Here is some of my work in the past three months. If anyone is insterested in it, you could leave a massage and we could have further discussion.

The project mainly focus on calculate text-similaries by different models, and the data we use is the submission information of academic papers, which is an open dataset for nlp.

### Basic Information :
* KnowledgeGruph_P1 : Data Analysis. Based on the given data of papers of different categories, we would find some statistics of them, such as finding top categories on different years.

* KnowledgeGruph_P2 : Further Data Analysis . Now we want to focus to the categories which ocuppy the top-five number of paper from 2014 to 2020, finding thier daily  

* KnowledgeGruph_P3 : Transform the statistics

* KnowledgeGruph_P4 : Calculate Texts Similarities by the method of a paper 

* KnowledgeGruph_P5 : Data Abstraction

* KnowledgeGruph_P6 : Calculate Text-Similarity By IF-IDF

* KnowledgeGruph_P7 : EDA of the result of P6

* KnowledgeGruph_P8 : Transform the processed data

* KnowledgeGruph_P9 + P11 : Calculate Text-Similarities by LDA Model

* KnowledgeGruph_P11 ：Calculate Text-Similarities by Doc2Vec Model

* KnowledgeGruph_P11 ：Triple Extraction by Spacy_1

* KnowledgeGruph_P11 ：Triple Extraction by Spacy_2

* KnowledgeGruph_P11 ：Triple Extraction by Open Information Extraction (OIE)
